MERN Learning Management System (LMS)
=====================================

**Version 1.2.0**

Overview
--------

This is a fork of the **MERN LMS**, originally built by Sangam Mukherjee. I plan to expand on its existing functionality by adding new features to enhance its capabilities and better suit organizational needs.

### Planned Features:

-   **SSO/Auth0 Integration**: Streamline login processes with Single Sign-On (SSO) using Auth0.
-   **Documentation**: Add comprehensive documentation for better usability and onboarding.
-   **Add Tests to Courses**: Enable the creation and management of quizzes/tests for each course.
-   **Company Branding**: Customize the LMS interface to align with specific organizational branding.
-   **Rich Text Editor**: Introduce rich text editing for the introduction section and other pages for enhanced content formatting.
